Artisan is the command-line interface included with Laravel. It provides a number of helpful commands that can assist you while you build your application. Artisan lives at the root of your application as the `artisan` script and provides several commands that can help you build your application with ease.

## What is Artisan?

*   **Command-Line Tool:** A PHP script (`artisan`) located at the root of your Laravel project.
*   **Automation & Scaffolding:** Used for automating repetitive tasks, generating boilerplate code (like controllers, models, migrations, etc.), managing database schemas, running tests, and more.
*   **Extensible:** You can create your own custom Artisan commands.

## Using Artisan

To view a list of all available Artisan commands, you may run the `list` command:

```bash
php artisan list
```

Or simply:
```bash
php artisan
```

Every command also includes a "help" screen which displays and describes the command's available arguments and options. To view a help screen, prepend the command's name with `help`:

```bash
php artisan help migrate
```

## Common Artisan Commands

Here are some of the most frequently used Artisan commands:

### Application Management
*   `php artisan serve`: Starts Laravel's built-in development server (usually on `http://localhost:8000`).
*   `php artisan down`: Puts the application into maintenance mode.
*   `php artisan up`: Brings the application out of maintenance mode.
*   `php artisan env`: Displays the current framework environment (e.g., `local`, `production`).
*   `php artisan config:cache`: Creates a cache file for faster configuration loading.
*   `php artisan config:clear`: Removes the configuration cache file.
*   `php artisan route:cache`: Creates a route cache file for faster route registration.
*   `php artisan route:clear`: Removes the route cache file.
*   `php artisan view:cache`: Compiles all Blade views for faster rendering.
*   `php artisan view:clear`: Clears all compiled Blade views.
*   `php artisan optimize`: Caches framework bootstrap files, configuration, and routes (often used in production).
*   `php artisan optimize:clear`: Clears all cached files generated by `optimize`.

### Code Generation (make commands)
Artisan's `make` commands are used to generate various classes and files:
*   `php artisan make:controller NameController`: Creates a new controller class.
    *   `php artisan make:controller PhotoController --resource`: Creates a resource controller.
*   `php artisan make:model ModelName`: Creates a new Eloquent model class.
    *   `php artisan make:model Post -mcr`: Creates a model, migration, and resource controller for `Post`.
*   `php artisan make:middleware MiddlewareName`: Creates a new middleware class.
*   `php artisan make:migration create_users_table`: Creates a new database migration file.
*   `php artisan make:seeder UserSeeder`: Creates a new database seeder class.
*   `php artisan make:factory PostFactory`: Creates a new model factory.
*   `php artisan make:request StorePostRequest`: Creates a new form request class for validation.
*   `php artisan make:command CustomCommand`: Creates a new custom Artisan command.
*   `php artisan make:job ProcessPodcast`: Creates a new queued job class.
*   `php artisan make:event PodcastProcessed`: Creates a new event class.
*   `php artisan make:listener SendPodcastNotification`: Creates a new event listener class.
*   `php artisan make:notification InvoicePaid`: Creates a new notification class.
*   `php artisan make:policy PostPolicy`: Creates a new policy class for authorization.
*   `php artisan make:provider RiakServiceProvider`: Creates a new service provider class.
*   `php artisan make:test UserTest`: Creates a new feature test class.
    *   `php artisan make:test UserTest --unit`: Creates a new unit test.

### Database
*   `php artisan migrate`: Runs all outstanding database migrations.
*   `php artisan migrate:rollback`: Rolls back the last database migration.
*   `php artisan migrate:reset`: Rolls back all database migrations.
*   `php artisan migrate:refresh`: Rolls back all migrations and then re-runs them.
*   `php artisan migrate:status`: Shows the status of each migration.
*   `php artisan db:seed`: Runs database seeders to populate the database with data.
    *   `php artisan db:seed --class=UserSeeder`: Runs a specific seeder.
*   `php artisan db:wipe`: Drops all tables, views, and types from the database.

### Tinker (Interactive REPL)
*   `php artisan tinker`: Opens an interactive shell (PsySH) that allows you to interact with your Laravel application, including your Eloquent models, jobs, events, and more, directly from the command line.

```php
// Inside Tinker session
App\Models\User::count();
App\Models\User::find(1);
factory(App\Models\User::class)->create();
```

### Queues
*   `php artisan queue:work`: Starts a queue worker to process jobs.
*   `php artisan queue:failed`: Lists all failed queue jobs.
*   `php artisan queue:retry <id>`: Retries a failed queue job.

This is just a subset of the commands available. Artisan is a powerful tool that significantly boosts developer productivity when working with Laravel.
