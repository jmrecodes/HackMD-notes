# What is Laravel?

Laravel is an open-source web application framework built on top of PHP, renowned for its elegant syntax and a rich set of features designed to make web development faster, more efficient, and enjoyable.

## MVC Architecture

Laravel follows the **Model-View-Controller (MVC)** architectural pattern. This pattern is crucial for organizing code and separating concerns within an application:

*   **Model:**
    *   Represents your application's data and business logic.
    *   Interacts directly with your database (e.g., retrieving user information, saving blog posts, managing product inventory).
    *   Contains the rules and logic for how data can be created, stored, and modified.

*   **View:**
    *   This is what the user sees and interacts with â€“ the User Interface (UI).
    *   Displays data provided by the Controller.
    *   Typically written in HTML, often enhanced with Laravel's Blade templating engine for dynamic content.

*   **Controller:**
    *   Acts as an intermediary between the Model and the View.
    *   Handles incoming user requests (e.g., when a user visits a URL or submits a form).
    *   Fetches data from the Model based on the request.
    *   Passes that data to the appropriate View to be rendered and presented to the user.

This separation makes applications easier to maintain, scale, and test.

## Key Features Overview

Laravel comes packed with features that streamline the development process:

*   **Eloquent ORM:** An intuitive way to interact with databases using PHP objects.
*   **Blade Templating Engine:** A powerful engine for creating dynamic views with clean syntax.
*   **Artisan Console:** A command-line interface for common tasks like code generation and database management.
*   **Routing:** A flexible system for defining application URLs and their handlers.
*   **Middleware:** A mechanism for filtering HTTP requests.
*   **Security:** Built-in protection against common web vulnerabilities.
*   **Database Migrations & Seeding:** Version control for your database schema and tools for populating test data.
*   **Service Container & Service Providers:** Advanced tools for dependency management and bootstrapping.
*   **Vibrant Ecosystem:** Access to numerous official and community packages.
